## Download the Code

Download the code from the repository: https://github.com/nyeddana22/psoft-command-integration

## Install python3 using Homebrew

If you don't have python3 installed on your system already, please follow the below instructions:

1. To install Homebrew, open Terminal or your favorite OS X terminal emulator and run

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

The script will explain what changes it will make and prompt you before the installation begins. Once youâ€™ve installed Homebrew, insert the Homebrew directory at the top of your PATH environment variable. You can do this by adding the following line at the bottom of your ~/.profile file

```
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python/libexec/bin:$PATH"
```

2. Install Python 3:

```
brew install python
```

## Set up a virtual environment

1. Navigate to the directory that contains the code by running

```
cd /path/to/your/project/
```

2. Create a virtual environment named venv:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

This creates a folder named venv inside your project directory.
Inside this folder, it sets up a lightweight virtual Python environment with its own python and pip.

3. Activate your virtual environment

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Install Dependencies

Once you are inside the /venv folder that contains all the scripts, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Set up your .env file to store your long-lived API token

1. Generate an API token from Command using this link: https://command.verkada.com/admin/org-settings/verkada-api

2. In order to securely store your long-lived API token such that the main script does not contain plain text API keys, you will need to create a .env file in the root directory of your project.

In the root directory of your project, create a file named .env. This file will contain your API key generated from Command in the following format:

```
EXTENDED_API_TOKEN="your_api_key_here"
```

This file is already added to .gitignore which will ensure your keys will remain local to your system.

## Create a launchctl file to schedule the script to run every 10 minutes

1. Create a plist file for launchd: launchd jobs are defined in Property List (plist) files. Create a plist file in the ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ directory by running the following command:

```
vim ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.verkada.api.plist
```

2. Copy and paste the below configuration lines to the file, replacing all the values within the <string> tags with the actual paths to your Python script and virtual environment.

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>Label</key>
    <string>com.verkada.api</string>

    <key>ProgramArguments</key>
    <array>
     <string>/path/to/python3.13/in/your/venv</string>
     <string>/path/to/the/userSync.py/file/in/your/venv</string>
    </array>

    <key>WorkingDirectory</key>
    <string>/directory/to/your/project</string>

    <key>StartInterval</key>
    <integer>600</integer>

    <key>StandardOutPath</key>
    <string>/directory/to/store/output_logging/of/this/plist/file</string>

    <key>StandardErrorPath</key>
    <string>/directory/to/store/error_logging/of/this/plist/file/string>
  </dict>
</plist>
```

3. Load the plist file

```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.verkada.api.plist
```

4. Verify that the task is running

```
launchctl list | grep com.verkada.api
```

5. Monitor the log files for any errors in excecution. If there are no errors, you should see the running log of the script update periodically with every update.
